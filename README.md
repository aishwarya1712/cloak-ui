# cloak-ui
This repository contains the front-end for Cloak, a product that redacts unnecessary data from usersâ€™ LLM chatbot queries.
Cloak is React-based Chrome Extension built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [MUI (Material UI)](https://mui.com/), and [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/).

```

### 4. Load in chrome
